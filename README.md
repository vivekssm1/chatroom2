## How Rooms Work

| Use case | How to do it |
|---|---|
| 1-on-1 chat | Both users enter the same unique room name (e.g. `alice-bob-private`) |
| Group chat | Share the room name with multiple people |
| Multiple rooms | Each room is completely isolated |

---

## Architecture

```
client (browser)
    │  WebSocket (Socket.io)
    ▼
server.js (Node.js + Express)
    │
    ├── rooms{}  ← in-memory store
    │     ├── room1: { messages[], users{} }
    │     └── room2: { messages[], users{} }
    │
    └── setInterval ← purges messages > 24h every 30min
```

No database needed. All messages are stored in RAM and automatically cleared after 24 hours.
